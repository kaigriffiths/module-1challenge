# Module 1

## User Story
AS A marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines

## Criteria
When I view the source code,
then I find semantic HTML elements.
When I view the structure of the HTML elements,
then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
When I view the image elements,
then I find accessible alt attributes.
When I view the heading attributes,
then they fall in sequential order.
When I view the title element,
then I find a concise, descriptive title.
